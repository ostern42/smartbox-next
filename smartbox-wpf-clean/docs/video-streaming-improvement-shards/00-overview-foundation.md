# Video Streaming Improvement Plan - Overview & Foundation

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to improve the video streaming client/website to fully leverage the new FFmpeg video engine implemented in the SmartBox medical capture system. The improvements focus on integrating real-time capabilities, unifying components, and enhancing playback quality while maintaining medical-grade standards.

## üìã Objectives

1. **Integrate** streaming player with new FFmpeg video engine API
2. **Unify** timeline components and eliminate duplication
3. **Enhance** real-time capabilities with WebSocket integration
4. **Improve** playback quality with adaptive bitrate and buffering
5. **Strengthen** error recovery and resilience
6. **Modernize** codebase structure and patterns

## ‚úÖ Pre-Operation Validation

### Resource Requirements
- **Token usage**: ~25K estimated
- **Complexity score**: 0.75 (High)
- **Risk assessment**: Medium (existing functionality must remain stable)
- **Files to modify**: 8-10 JavaScript files
- **New files to create**: 3-4 enhancement modules

### Compatibility Checks
- ‚úÖ New FFmpeg API is operational
- ‚úÖ WebSocket infrastructure in place
- ‚úÖ HLS.js library compatible
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple timeline implementations need consolidation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate streaming services need unification

## üìê Incremental Implementation Plan

The implementation is divided into 5 phases:

### Phase Overview

1. **Phase 1: Foundation Integration (Priority: High)**
   - Connect streaming player to FFmpeg API
   - Implement WebSocket real-time updates
   - Create unified thumbnail system

2. **Phase 2: Timeline Consolidation (Priority: High)**
   - Create unified timeline component
   - Implement migration strategy

3. **Phase 3: Playback Enhancements (Priority: Medium)**
   - Adaptive bitrate switching
   - Enhanced buffering strategy
   - Frame-accurate controls

4. **Phase 4: Error Recovery & Resilience (Priority: Medium)**
   - Robust error handling
   - Connection resilience

5. **Phase 5: Advanced Features (Priority: Low)**
   - Collaborative features
   - Multi-user support
