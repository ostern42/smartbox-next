## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

1. **Review Foundation**: Start with [00-overview-foundation.md](00-overview-foundation.md) to understand the project scope
2. **Implement Core**: Follow phases 1-2 for essential functionality
3. **Enhance Quality**: Add phases 3-4 for production readiness
4. **Add Advanced**: Implement phase 5 for collaborative features
5. **Test & Deploy**: Use the implementation guide for rollout

## üéØ Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Week 1-2)
- Phase 1: Foundation Integration
- Phase 2: Timeline Consolidation

### Medium Priority (Week 3)
- Phase 3: Playback Enhancements
- Phase 4: Error Recovery

### Low Priority (Week 4)
- Phase 5: Advanced Features
- Testing & Refinement

## üìù Notes

- Each phase builds upon the previous one
- Feature flags enable gradual rollout
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Extensive testing at each phase

## ü§ù Contributing

When implementing these improvements:
1. Follow the phase-by-phase approach
2. Test thoroughly at each stage
3. Monitor performance metrics
4. Document any deviations
5. Update tests accordingly
