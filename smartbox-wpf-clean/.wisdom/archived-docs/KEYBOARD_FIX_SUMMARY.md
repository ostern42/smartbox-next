# Keyboard AltGr/Shift Display Fix - Summary

**Fixed**: 2025-07-11
**Issue**: Shift and AltGr characters were not displayed when modifiers were pressed

## Changes Made:

### 1. keyboard.js - Removed AltGr span elements
- **Line 106-114**: Removed the creation of separate `altgr-char` span elements
- These were causing display issues with the updateKeyLabels function

### 2. keyboard.js - Simplified toggleAltGr function  
- **Line 270-281**: Removed the opacity toggle for altgr-char spans
- Now only toggles the active class and calls updateKeyLabels

### 3. keyboard.js - Fixed updateKeyLabels function
- **Line 304-318**: Removed complex logic for handling AltGr spans
- Now simply updates button.textContent with the appropriate character
- The function already had correct priority logic: AltGr > Shift > Caps > Normal

### 4. keyboard.css - Added visual indicators (optional enhancement)
- Added ::after pseudo-elements to show AltGr characters in corner
- Shows small indicator when keys have AltGr alternatives
- Hides indicator when AltGr is active (since main char shows it)

## How it works now:

1. **Normal state**: Keys show their default characters
2. **Shift pressed**: Keys show shift characters (!"§$%& etc.)
3. **AltGr pressed**: Keys show AltGr characters (@€{[]} etc.)
4. **Caps Lock**: Letters show uppercase
5. **Visual feedback**: Active modifier keys highlighted in blue

## Testing:

Open `test-keyboard.html` in a browser to verify:
- Shift characters display correctly when Shift is pressed
- AltGr characters display correctly when AltGr is pressed
- Characters revert to normal when modifiers are released
- Visual indicators work as expected

## Result:

The keyboard now properly displays alternative characters when modifiers are active, making it much easier for users to see what character will be typed before pressing a key.
