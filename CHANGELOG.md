- Replaced LowLagPhotoCapture (500ms per frame) with MediaFrameReader
- Fixed partial class warnings for WinRT compatibility
- Fixed async method warnings
- Fixed UI thread issues for frame display
- Fixed build locks with fix-locks.ps1

#### Changed
- Video capture now uses proper streaming instead of photo capture
- Frame handlers now use DispatcherQueue for UI updates
- Capture button works while streaming continues

#### Discovered
- LowLagPhotoCapture is for photos, not video (causes 500ms delay)
- MediaFrameReader is the correct API for video streaming
- Camera supports YUY2 format at multiple resolutions up to 1920x1080 @ 30 FPS
- Frames arrive but preview not updating (UI thread issue)

## [Unreleased]

### Session 8 - 2025-01-07 (Video Capture Deep Dive)

#### Added
- CameraAnalyzer.cs - Deep hardware analysis tool
- DirectShowCapture.cs - Professional capture exploration
- "Analyze Camera" button for detailed hardware report
- Professional video capture research documentation
- Media Foundation + GPU acceleration plan
- NuGet packages: Vortice.Windows, FlashCap, FFmpeg.AutoGen

#### Fixed
- YUY2 to BGRA8 format conversion in OnHighPerfFrameArrived
- Identified root cause of poor performance (format mismatch)

#### Changed
- Understanding that MediaCapture is consumer-grade, not suitable
- Decision to use Media Foundation instead of DirectShow
- Consolidated planning/specs folders into .wisdom
- Added "STRUCTURES FIRST!" principle to wisdom

#### Discovered
- Camera outputs YUY2, SoftwareBitmapSource needs BGRA8
- Media Foundation is actively developed, DirectShow deprecated
- GPU acceleration reduces CPU from 30% to 5-10%
- Professional software uses hardware-level APIs
- 60 FPS is achievable with proper architecture

#### Research Results
- Comprehensive analysis of video capture approaches
