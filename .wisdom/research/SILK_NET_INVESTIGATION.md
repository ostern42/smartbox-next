# Silk.NET Investigation for 60 FPS Video Capture

## What is Silk.NET?

Silk.NET is a high-performance, cross-platform .NET wrapper for many native libraries including:
- OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX (D3D11, D3D12, DXGI)
- OpenAL, OpenXR
- SDL, GLFW
- Media Foundation
- And many more!

License: MIT (perfect for commercial use!)

## Why Silk.NET Could Be The Solution

1. **Modern .NET Support** - Built for .NET 5/6/7/8+
2. **High Performance** - Zero-overhead bindings
3. **Active Development** - Microsoft backed, part of .NET Foundation
4. **DirectX Support** - D3D11 for GPU acceleration
5. **Media Foundation** - For camera access
6. **MIT License** - Commercial use allowed

## Key Features for Video Capture

- Direct3D11 for GPU processing
- DXGI for swap chain management
- Media Foundation for camera access
- Compute shaders for YUV→RGB conversion
- Zero-copy texture sharing

## Investigation Plan

1. Check Silk.NET availability on NuGet
2. Verify D3D11 support
3. Check Media Foundation bindings
4. Find examples of video capture
5. Test WinUI3 SwapChainPanel integration

## Expected Architecture with Silk.NET

```
Camera → Media Foundation → D3D11 Texture → SwapChainPanel
              ↓                    ↓
         [Silk.NET API]      [GPU Conversion]
                                   ↓
                            60+ FPS Display
```

## Advantages Over Other Solutions

- **vs DirectN**: Actually works with .NET 8!
- **vs FlashCap**: Lower level, more control
- **vs P/Invoke**: Type-safe, easier to use
- **vs WebView2**: Native performance, no browser overhead
