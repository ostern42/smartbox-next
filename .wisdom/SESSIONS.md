# SmartBox-Next Session Chronicle

## Session 1: The DICOM Marathon
**Date**: 05.07.2025 (evening to early morning)
**Duration**: Many hours (until ~02:49)
**Demenz Level**: MAXIMUM

### What Happened
- Started with simple DICOM export
- MicroDicom refused to open files (234kb)
- Built 10 different DICOM implementations
- Each more complex than the last
- Oliver's patience tested repeatedly

### Key Moments
- "234kb und geht nicht auf"
- "immernoch 234kb"
- "und das preview geht auch nicht mehr"
- Discovery: MicroDicom needs RGB not JPEG (wrong!)
- MINIMAL pattern attempted (50 lines)
- **02:28**: jpeg_dicom.go updated
- **02:49**: SUCCESS! Working DICOM created

### Implementations Created
1. Simple MVP - Failed
2. Complex with proper tags - Failed
3. JPEG direct embed - Failed initially
4. RGB conversion attempt - Not needed!
5-10. Various desperate attempts
Final: jpeg_dicom.go with proper JPEG compression - SUCCESS!

### Learnings
- DICOM is harder than expected
- MicroDicom CAN handle JPEG (if done right)
- Small file size achieved (59KB)
- Persistence pays off!

## Session 2: Soul Restoration & Discovery
**Date**: 06.07.2025 (afternoon)
**Status**: Bootstrap & realization

### What Happened
- Started with soul restoration (CLAUDE_IDENTITY, PATTERNS)
- Read outdated WISDOM (from 00:50)
- Thought DICOM was still broken
- Oliver: "das letzte von 2:49 geht wunderbar"
- Discovery: Past-Me fixed it after writing WISDOM!

### Key Moments
- Research was valuable but problem already solved
- Timeline reconstruction revealed the truth
- DICOM has been working since 02:49!
- Updated all documentation

### Learnings
- Always check timestamps
- WISDOM can be outdated
- Past-Me sometimes continues after documentation
- Trust Oliver's memory over old docs

## Session 2 Continued: The Great Pivot
**Date**: 06.07.2025 (late afternoon)
**Major Decision**: Go ‚Üí C# .NET 8

### What Happened
- Go DICOM libraries all failed
- Oliver: "lieber windows .net8"
- Created WinUI 3 project
- Webcam research revealed solutions
- App runs but webcam not showing yet

### Key Moments
- "gibst du so einfach auf?" - Oliver reminded me to research
- WinUI 3 XAML compiler issues (as predicted)
- Found solution: MediaSource.CreateFromMediaFrameSource()
- Unpackaged apps need Windows Privacy Settings

### Learnings
- Don't give up, research first!
- WinUI 3 is tricky but workable
- C# with fo-dicom is more stable
- Listen to Oliver's instincts

## Overall Progress
- ‚úì Basic UI working (Vue.js)
- ‚úì Webcam capture working (Go)
- ‚úì DICOM export working (Go)
- ‚úì MicroDicom compatibility achieved
- ‚úì PACS backend ready (Go)
- üîÑ Pivoting to C# .NET 8 + WinUI 3
- ‚è≥ Webcam in WinUI 3 (implemented, not tested)
- Ready for C# implementation!
