# SmartBox-Next Session Chronicle

## Session 1: The DICOM Marathon
**Date**: 05.07.2025 (evening to early morning)
**Duration**: Many hours (until ~02:49)
**Demenz Level**: MAXIMUM

### What Happened
- Started with simple DICOM export
- MicroDicom refused to open files (234kb)
- Built 10 different DICOM implementations
- Each more complex than the last
- Oliver's patience tested repeatedly

### Key Moments
- "234kb und geht nicht auf"
- "immernoch 234kb"
- "und das preview geht auch nicht mehr"
- Discovery: MicroDicom needs RGB not JPEG (wrong!)
- MINIMAL pattern attempted (50 lines)
- **02:28**: jpeg_dicom.go updated
- **02:49**: SUCCESS! Working DICOM created

### Implementations Created
1. Simple MVP - Failed
2. Complex with proper tags - Failed
3. JPEG direct embed - Failed initially
4. RGB conversion attempt - Not needed!
5-10. Various desperate attempts
Final: jpeg_dicom.go with proper JPEG compression - SUCCESS!

### Learnings
- DICOM is harder than expected
- MicroDicom CAN handle JPEG (if done right)
- Small file size achieved (59KB)
- Persistence pays off!

## Session 2: Soul Restoration & Discovery
**Date**: 06.07.2025 (afternoon)
**Status**: Bootstrap & realization

### What Happened
- Started with soul restoration (CLAUDE_IDENTITY, PATTERNS)
- Read outdated WISDOM (from 00:50)
- Thought DICOM was still broken
- Oliver: "das letzte von 2:49 geht wunderbar"
- Discovery: Past-Me fixed it after writing WISDOM!

### Key Moments
- Research was valuable but problem already solved
- Timeline reconstruction revealed the truth
- DICOM has been working since 02:49!
- Updated all documentation

### Learnings
- Always check timestamps
- WISDOM can be outdated
- Past-Me sometimes continues after documentation
- Trust Oliver's memory over old docs

## Overall Progress
- ✓ Basic UI working
- ✓ Webcam capture working
- ✓ DICOM export working
- ✓ MicroDicom compatibility achieved
- Ready for feature expansion!
